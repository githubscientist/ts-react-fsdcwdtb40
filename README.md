# React

- It is a Framework for building user interfaces.
- It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It is used for building single-page applications and mobile applications.

single page applications (SPA) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the app.

## Features of React

1. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance.

Virtual DOM:

    - It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
    - It allows React to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page.
    - For this, it creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory and updates it when the state of the application changes. Then, it compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and updates only the parts that have changed.

2. It uses a component-based architecture.

component:

    - It is a reusable piece of UI.
    - It allows developers to break down the UI into smaller, manageable pieces.

3. It uses JSX (JavaScript XML) or TSX (TypeScript XML) syntax.
   - JavaScript XML - JavaScript + HTML
   - TypeScript XML - TypeScript + HTML
   - It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax in their JavaScript code, making it easier.

### Render

- It is the process of displaying the UI on the screen.
- It is the process of inserting the React components into the DOM.
